# Azure Key Vault (AKV) member keys
We have different guides to illustrate how to use AKV member keys.

For production environments we need to sign proposals with an Azure Key Vault (AKV) key.
This signing key will be generated on AKV and will never leave, so customers can leverage the highly protected environment of a Hardware Security Module (HSM).

For more information see [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal).
